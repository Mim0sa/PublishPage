#####1.Tell us about the features and technologies you used in your Swift playground.

我应用的名字叫做“艺术相机”，顾名思义，这是一款可以将你自己的照片转换成为艺术名画风格的照片的应用，我已经设置了许多世界名画在应用内，比如梵高的星空、爱德华·蒙克的呐喊和一些别的。同时你也可以调整艺术风格迁移的程度。

除此之外，我还设置了一些相纸比如facebook风格相纸，你可以通过AR技术将你的艺术风格迁移照片放在相纸中然后挂在墙上。这样你家里就可以有你自己的世界名画！

在这个应用中，艺术风格是已经内置的并且是有限的，我同时还制作了一个可以让用户输入两张图片的应用，它可以将其中一张照片获得另一张照片的艺术风格（这真的很酷）。但是因为这次提交的大小限制（25mb太小了😢），和它不太稳定，所以没能提交它。

在这个应用中，我使用了UIKit来建立界面，在机器学习方面，我使用Python来训练模型，然后用coremltools把它转化成mlmodel文件。在AR方面，我使用了ARKit来支持我的AR效果。

The name of my playground is called "Art Camera". As the name implies, this is a playground that can convert your own photos into art-style photos. I have set up many world famous paintings in the application, such as Van Gogh's "The Starry Night", Edward Munch's "The Scream" and so on. You can adjust the degree of style transfer according to your preferences.

In addition, I also set up some photo papers such as facebook style photo paper, you can use AR technology to put your artistic style transfered photos in photo paper and hang on the wall. This way you can have your own world famous paintings at home!

In this app, the art style is already built-in and limited, and I also created an app that lets the user enter two images, which can take one photo to get the artistic style of another photo (it’s really 🆒). But because of the size limit of this submission (25mb is too small😢), and it is not stable, so i am not able to submit it.

In this application, I used UIKit to build the interface. In machine learning side, I used python to train the model and then converted it into mlmodel files using coremltools. On the AR side, I used ARKit to support my AR effects.

#####2.If you've shared or considered sharing your coding knowledge and enthusiasm for computer science with others, let us know.

在我的大学里，我参加了iOS Club，这是一个学生们可以交流和学习有关iOS开发方面经验的社团，我参加这个社团已经有两年了，我会经常分享一些我学习编程的经验，有时介绍一些新的技术，有时举行一些小的编程比赛。

在去年的暑假，我在上海科技馆用iPad教一组小学生学习编程。（夏令营）。来帮助他们理解什么是编程，并且初步尝试着去编程。我同时也被邀请去介绍我制作App以及playgrounds的经验和想法在一个制造工厂。我鼓励工厂员工学习新知识像编程，并且鼓励他们在工作之外形成他们自己的爱好。

去年9月份开始，我在一家公司担任iOS开发的实习生，在平时的Code Review中我也和我的同事们分享过使用Swift的优点以及如何制作一个Playground（因为在我来之前，公司的项目基本上都是使用Object-C开发），同时在我任职期间，也将我参与的一个Object-C开发项目转换成了Swift开发。

除此之外，我计划参加今年年底去偏远地区的支教，这次的主题是给孩子们介绍编程、艺术和设计。（去年的主题是给孩子们介绍电子设备）。

让我很开心的是在我分享编程知识时，我真的觉得我从中获得了很多，我可以学习到其他人给我分享的知识，同时也交到了许多好朋友。

In my university, I participated in the iOS Club, a community where students can exchange and learn about iOS development. I have been in this community for two years, and I often share some of my experience in programming. Sometimes introducing some new techniques, sometimes holding small programming competitions.

In the summer of last year, I used the iPad to teach a group of primary school students to learn programming at the Shanghai Science and Technology Museum(A summer camp). To help them understand what programming is, and initially try to program. I was also invited to a manufacturing facility to introducing my experience and ideas about making apps and playgrounds. I encouraged factory employees to learn new things like programming and form their own hobbies outside of work.

Since September last year, I worked as an intern for iOS development in a company. In the usual Code Review, I also shared with my colleagues the advantages of using Swift and how to make a Playground (because before I came, the company's project basically use Objective-C). And during my tenure, I also converted a project I participated in to mixed development project(OC and Swift).

In addition, I plan to participate in teaching in remote areas by the end of this year. The theme of this time is to introduce children to programming, art and design. (The theme of last year was to introduce children to electronic devices).

What makes me very happy is that when I share programming knowledge, I really feel that I have gained a lot from it. I can learn the knowledge that other people have shared with me, and I have also made many good friends.

#####3.Apps on the App Store

我制作了一个App叫做“Cell”，它可以重现生物课堂上的实验，比如用显微镜观察洋葱细胞、观察动物细胞和植物细胞的区别和一些别的。它现在还是有点粗糙，我之后会完善它的😁。

我做这一款App的起因是在2016年我学校的一次支教活动，在那次支教中，我学校的老师和学生们带着iPad去贵州一个较偏远贫困地区的学校支教，指导当地学生如何使用iPad以及一些软件的简单操作（如Pages，Keynote）。

在这次活动之后，老师们与我分享了许多感想，也给我看了他们在当地拍的照片，当时让我印象深刻的是老师告诉我，当地的学生们仅仅只有语文和数学两门课程，并且在这样的情况下，当地的师资力量和教学资源还是远远不足，我听了之后深受触动，并且也萌发了能不能在iPad上制作一个，能让学生们不需要课本和其他教学器材（如显微镜），也能体验到做实验和学习知识的App的想法。

I made an ipad app called "Cell" that can reproduce experiments just like the biology lesson, such as observing onion cells with a microscope, observing the differences between animal cells and plant cells, and others. It is still a bit rough now, and I will perfect it later😁.

My app's id is 1445392637.

The reason why I made this app was a teaching activity in my school in 2016. In that teaching, my school teachers and students took the iPad to teach in a school in a remote and impoverished area in Guizhou to guide local students. Simple operations using the iPad and some software (such as Pages, Keynote).

After the event, the teachers shared a lot of thoughts with me and showed me many photos. What impressed me at the time was that the teacher told me that the local students only had two courses in language and mathematics. And under such circumstances, the local faculty and teaching resources are still far from enough. After listening to it, I was deeply touched and thought whether I can make one app on the iPad, so that students do not need textbooks and other teaching equipment (such as a microscope).let students can experience the experiment with an app.That's why I made this app.

#####4.Comments

I would like to say Swift helps me a lot. Before I contact Swfit, I learned C, and I made a little game(A kind of board game) with a simple AI by C. This game took me a long time to develop because C is very complex and difficult to use which made me crazy. 

After got my own MacBook, I started learning Swift on the iOS platform, then I started to make my own app, ran it on my iPhone and my passion for the development of app grows in constant because Swift is so easy to use. After that, I learned the Objective-C language and made my understanding of Swift better. 

It's not that C is not good. What I want to say is that Swift has helped me a lot when I started learning programming. In this developing process I enjoy the great joy and I am happy that I met Swift.

This experience makes me more certain of my belief that I want to be a iOS developer. It is amazing that I can put a good idea and intelligent devices together to help others or make others feel happy. At the same time, I also hope that I can communicate with the global developers to learn more knowledge.
